Hello Everyone!
My name is Nick and my interests are based on Data Science. My goal is to one day success as a Data Scientist. I am still studying and I have long way a head. I've been hearing that GitHub is widely used, so here I am, looking forward to make great use of it one day, participating or even starting my own group project.
